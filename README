Overview
========

nosystem is a tiny library which replaces libsystemd
(http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) with stubs. It makes it possible
to run some binaries linked against libsystemd, without having to run any
systemd daemons.

It is heavily inspired by nobus (https://github.com/clbr/nobus) by Lauri
Kasanen.
